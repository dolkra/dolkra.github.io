        <p>​    Recenly I’ve been reading the famous writing book <em>The Elements of Style</em>, it sets a list of principles that writers should follow to construct a suitable composition.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h2 id="Elementary-Rules-of-Usage"><a href="#Elementary-Rules-of-Usage" class="headerlink" title="Elementary Rules of Usage"></a>Elementary Rules of Usage</h2><h3 id="1-Form-the-possessive-singular-of-nouns-with-‘s"><a href="#1-Form-the-possessive-singular-of-nouns-with-‘s" class="headerlink" title="1. Form the possessive singular of nouns with ‘s."></a>1. Form the possessive singular of nouns with ‘s.</h3><p>​    Follow this rule whatever the final consonant. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Shaw’s project</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names in <em>-es</em> and <em>-is</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>the heel of Achilles</em> instead of <em>Achilles’ heel</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    The pronominal possessives <em>hers</em>, <em>its</em>, <em>theirs</em>, <em>yours</em>, and <em>oneself</em> have no apostrophe.</p>
<h3 id="2-In-a-series-of-three-or-more-terms-with-a-single-conjunction-use-a-comma-after-each-term-except-the-last"><a href="#2-In-a-series-of-three-or-more-terms-with-a-single-conjunction-use-a-comma-after-each-term-except-the-last" class="headerlink" title="2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last."></a>2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.</h3><p>​    Thus write,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>textbook, laptop, and ball pen</em></p>
<p><em>weak, tiny but sustainable</em></p>
<p><em>I charged the phone, pull some paper, and go to the toilet</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    The abbreviation <em>etc.</em>, even if only a single term comes before it, is always preceded by a comma.</p>
<h3 id="3-Enclose-parenthetic-expressions-between-commas"><a href="#3-Enclose-parenthetic-expressions-between-commas" class="headerlink" title="3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas."></a>3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>The words of your letter content, although it’s a little offensive, is quite in depth.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    This rule is difficult to apply; it is frequently hard to decide whether a single word, such as <em>however</em>, or a brief phrase, is or is not parenthetic. If the interruption to the flow of the sentence<br>is but slight, the writer may safely omit the commas. But whether the interruption be slight or considerable, he must never omit one comma and leave the other. Such punctuation as</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The tricky principle you see here, is actually applicable to many areas of science.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    is indefensible.</p>
<p>​    Non-restrictive relative clauses ( followed by <em>which</em>, <em>where</em>, <em>when</em>) are, in accordance with this rule, set off by commas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It was that funeral, when assorted people expressed emotions, struck me of the lapse of time.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    In these sentences the clauses introduced by <em>which</em>, <em>when</em>, and <em>where</em> are non-restrictive; they do not limit the application of the words on which they depend, but add, parenthetically,<br>statements supplementing those in the principal clauses. Each sentence is a combination of two statements which might have been made independently.</p>
<p>​    Restrictive relative clauses are not set off by commas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The man who baths in the sunshine seems to be enjoying the happiness of life.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    In this sentence the relative clause restricts the application of the word <em>man</em> to a single person. Unlike those above, the sentence cannot be split into two independent statements.</p>
<p>​    The abbreviations <em>etc.</em> and <em>jr.</em> are always preceded by a comma, and except at the end of a sentence, followed by one.</p>
<p>​    Similar in principle to the enclosing of parenthetic expressions between commas is the setting off by commas of phrases or dependent clauses preceding or following the main clause of a sentence. The sentences quoted in this section and under Rules 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, and 18 should afford sufficient guidance.</p>
<p>​    If a parenthetic expression is preceded by a conjunction, place the first comma before the conjunction, not after it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The car driver was talking to a phone with a smile, and a group people yelling at him, ended up in the crash accident.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="4-Place-a-comma-before-and-or-but-introducing-an-independent-clause"><a href="#4-Place-a-comma-before-and-or-but-introducing-an-independent-clause" class="headerlink" title="4. Place a comma before and or but introducing an independent clause."></a>4. Place a comma before and or but introducing an independent clause.</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>The practice part seems to be more difficult, and we don’t really have to read that many books.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>​    Sentences of this type, isolated from their context, may seem to be in need of rewriting. As they make complete sense when the comma is reached, the second clause has the appearance of an after-thought. Further, and, is the least specific of connectives. Used between independent clauses, it indicates only that a relation exists between them without defining that<br>relation. In the example above, the relation is that of <del>cause and result</del>. The two sentences might be rewritten:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As the practice part seems to be more difficult, we don’t really have to read that many books.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or the subordinate clauses might be replaced by phrases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Because of the excess difficulty of the practice part, we don’t really have to read that many books.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But a writer may err by making his sentences too uniformly compact and periodic, and an occasional loose sentence prevents the style from becoming too formal and gives the<br>reader a certain relief. Consequently, loose sentences of the type first quoted are common in easy, unstudied writing. But a writer should be careful not to construct too many of his<br>sentences after this pattern (see Rule 14).</p>
<p>Two-part sentences of which the second member is introduced by <em>as</em> (in the sense of <em>because</em>), <em>for</em>, <em>or</em>, <em>nor</em>, and <em>while</em> (in the sense of <em>and at the same time</em>) likewise require a comma before the conjunction.</p>
<p>If a dependent clause, or an introductory phrase requiring to be set off by a comma, precedes the second independent clause, no comma is needed after the conjunction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Friends are our trusted allies, but if we don’t spend some quality time to maintain the relationship, the friendship may fade away.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For two-part sentences connected by an adverb, see the next section.</p>
<h3 id="5-Do-not-join-independent-clauses-by-a-comma"><a href="#5-Do-not-join-independent-clauses-by-a-comma" class="headerlink" title="5. Do not join independent clauses by a comma."></a>5. Do not join independent clauses by a comma.</h3><p>If two or more clauses, grammatically complete and not joined by a conjunction, are to form a single compound sentence, the proper mark of punctuation is a semicolon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Video games is designed to be addictive; they know how to bring your dopamine out.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is of course equally correct to write the above as two sentences each, replacing the semicolons by periods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Video games is designed to be addictive. They know how to bring your dopamine out.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a conjunction is inserted, the proper mark is a comma (Rule 4).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Video games is designed to be addictive, for they know how to bring your dopamine out.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that if the second clause is preceded by an adverb, such as <em>accordingly</em>, <em>besides</em>, <em>so</em>, <em>then</em>, <em>therefore</em>, or <em>thus</em>, and not by a conjunction, the semicolon is still required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The plan ignored the time of risks; consequently it incurred fail.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, however, it is best, in writing, to avoid using <em>consequently</em> in this manner; there is danger that the writer who uses it at all may use it too often. A simple correction, usually serviceable, is to omit the word <em>consequently</em>, and begin the first clause with <em>as</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As the plan ignored the time of risks, it incurred a fail.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the clauses are very short, and are alike in form, a comma is usually permissible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rick’s silent, Morty’s yelling.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="6-Do-not-break-sentences-in-two"><a href="#6-Do-not-break-sentences-in-two" class="headerlink" title="6. Do not break sentences in two."></a>6. Do not break sentences in two.</h3><p>In other words, do not use periods for commas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I met them on a cruise several years ago. Coming home from Liverpool to New York.</em></p>
<p><em>He was an interesting talker. A man who had traveled all over the world, and lived in half a dozen countries.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both these examples, the first period should be replaced by a comma, and the following word begun with a small letter.</p>
<p>It is permissible to make an emphatic word or expression serve the purpose of a sentence and to punctuate it accordingly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again and again he failed. Hope’s gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer must, however, be certain that the emphasis is warranted, and that he will not be suspected of a mere blunder in punctuation.</p>
<p>Rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 cover the most important principles in the punctuation of ordinary sentences; they should be so thoroughly mastered that their application becomes second<br>nature.</p>
<h3 id="7-A-participial-phrase-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence-must-refer-to-the-grammatical-subject"><a href="#7-A-participial-phrase-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence-must-refer-to-the-grammatical-subject" class="headerlink" title="7. A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject."></a>7. A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.</h3><blockquote>
<p><em>Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>walking</em> refers to the subject of the sentence, not to the woman. If the writer wishes to make it refer to the woman, he must recast the sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>He saw a woman, accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the road.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participial phrases preceded by a conjunction or by a preposition, adjectives, and adjective phrases come under the same rule if they begin the sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>On arriving in Chicago, his friends met him at the station.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>&gt; When he arrived (or, On his arrival) in Chicago, his friends met him at the station.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A soldier of proved valor, they entrusted him with the defense of the city.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>&gt; A soldier of proved valor, he was entrusted with the defence of the city.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Young and inexperienced, the task seemed easy to me.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>&gt; Young and inexperienced, I thought the task easy.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Without a friend to counsel him, the temptation proved irresistible.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>&gt; Without a friend to counsel him, he found the temptation irresistible.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sentences violating this rule are often ludicrous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house very cheap.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="8-Divide-words-at-line-ends-in-accordance-with-their-formation-and-pronunciation"><a href="#8-Divide-words-at-line-ends-in-accordance-with-their-formation-and-pronunciation" class="headerlink" title="8. Divide words at line-ends, in accordance with their formation and pronunciation."></a>8. Divide words at line-ends, in accordance with their formation and pronunciation.</h3><p>  If there is room at the end of a line for one or more syllables of a word, but not for the whole word, divide the word, unless this involves cutting off only a single letter, or cutting off only two letters of a long word. No hard and fast rule for all words can be laid down. The principles most frequently applicable are:</p>
<p><strong>A. Divide the word according to its formation:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>know-ledge (not knowl-edge);</em></p>
<p><em>Shake-speare (not Shakes-peare);</em></p>
<p><em>de-scribe (not des-cribe);</em></p>
<p><em>atmo-sphere (not atmos-phere);</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>B. Divide “on the vowel:”</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>edi-ble (not ed-ible);</em></p>
<p><em>propo-sition;</em></p>
<p><em>ordi-nary;</em></p>
<p><em>espe-cial;</em></p>
<p><em>reli-gious;</em></p>
<p><em>oppo-nents;</em></p>
<p><em>regu-lar;</em></p>
<p><em>classi-fi-ca-tion (three divisions possible);</em></p>
<p><em>deco-rative;</em></p>
<p><em>presi-dent;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>C. Divide between double letters, unless they come at the end of the simple form of the word:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Apen-nines;</em></p>
<p><em>Cincin-nati;</em></p>
<p><em>refer-ring;</em></p>
<p><em>but tell-ing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The treatment of consonants in combination is best shown from examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>for-tune;</em></p>
<p><em>pic-ture;</em></p>
<p><em>presump-tuous;</em></p>
<p><em>illus-tration;</em></p>
<p><em>sub-stan-tial (either division);</em></p>
<p><em>indus-try;</em></p>
<p><em>instruc-tion;</em></p>
<p><em>sug-ges-tion;</em></p>
<p><em>incen-diary.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The student will do well to examine the syllable-division in a number of pages of any carefully printed book.</p>
